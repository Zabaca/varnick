/**
 * The agent, and the two halves of starting one.
 *
 * ## Who spawns what
 *
 * Three processes, and the split between them is the whole of ADR-0008:
 *
 *   * the **Harness runtime** holds the Sandbox. It computes the wrapping —
 *     `EstablishedSandbox.wrap()` gives argv, an environment overlay, and the
 *     directory to spawn in — and that answer contains no secret.
 *   * the **Rust host** performs the spawn, because that is where the credential
 *     already is. `credential_env()` in src-tauri/src/credential.rs is the one
 *     way the value leaves that module, and it goes into this process's
 *     environment: never into a string the host keeps, never across the bridge,
 *     never into a log.
 *   * the **agent host** — this file, run as a script — is what that spawn
 *     starts, inside `srt`. It opens the Claude Agent SDK session, which starts
 *     a Claude Code process as its child, inside `srt` too because containment
 *     wraps the whole tree (ADR-0003).
 *
 * The tempting shortcut is to let the runtime spawn the agent, since the runtime
 * is the half holding the Sandbox. That would mean sending the credential across
 * the bridge, which is the one thing that may never happen — see ADR-0008's
 * third rejection, which exists for exactly this ticket.
 *
 * ## The SDK's own sandbox stays off
 *
 * The kernel refuses `sandbox_apply` inside an existing sandbox, so leaving the
 * SDK's `sandbox` option on kills every Bash command with exit 71 (ADR-0003).
 * It is set to `enabled: false` below rather than merely left unset, because
 * "off" should be visible in the code that would be blamed for exit 71.
 *
 * ## The session is isolated from the developer's own Claude Code
 *
 * A Claude Code process reads settings, `CLAUDE.md`, MCP servers, plugins and
 * hooks off the filesystem, and reads a good deal more out of its environment.
 * Left alone it would pick up whichever of those the person launching varnick
 * happens to have — including things they set months ago and have forgotten.
 * That is unreproducible for everyone else, so varnick isolates by default and
 * takes a flag to inherit. See ADR-0010, and `agentEnvironment` below.
