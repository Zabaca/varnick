/*
  The slow suite. Everything here runs a real process under a real kernel
  sandbox, which is the only way to learn anything about a containment
  boundary — a mocked sandbox proves the policy compiles, not that it holds.

  This file carries the single probe ticket 01 owes: a command run under the
  policy cannot read the home directory. The full matrix — Read, Grep and Glob
  denied the same paths as Bash, denied binaries, reachable and unreachable
  hosts — is ticket 04, which needs a running agent.

  It skips, loudly, when the platform cannot run it. A boundary test that fails
  on Linux CI for want of bubblewrap teaches nobody anything, and a red suite
  everyone learns to ignore is worse than a skipped one.
