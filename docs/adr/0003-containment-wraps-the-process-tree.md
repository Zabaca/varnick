# Containment wraps the agent's process tree, not each Bash command

The Claude Agent SDK ships a `sandbox` option that looks like a boundary and is not: it restricts commands the agent *shells out to*, while `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `Write`, and `Edit` run inside the process without ever shelling out, so nothing hands them to the kernel. We therefore run the agent under `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime` (`srt`), the same engine applied to the whole process tree, which covers every tool by construction including ones added later.

Measured in `zbc/packages/agent` against SDK `0.3.220` on macOS, with `denyRead: [$HOME]` set:

```
Bash  cat ~/.zbc-read-probe/secret.txt  -> Operation not permitted
Read  ~/.zbc-read-probe/secret.txt      -> the file's contents
Grep  ~/.zbc-read-probe                 -> the file's contents
```

## Consequences

- **The two mechanisms cannot be combined.** The kernel refuses `sandbox_apply` inside an existing sandbox, so leaving the SDK's `sandbox` option enabled kills every Bash command with exit 71. The SDK option stays off.
- **Denying execution means denying read.** `srt` has no execute allowlist, so a binary is blocked by making it unreadable. `/usr/bin/security`, `/usr/bin/osascript`, `/usr/bin/open`, and `/usr/bin/sudo` are denied. **This does not work, measured while building ticket 10 — see the correction below.**
- **The agent must not be able to authenticate from the Keychain**, because an agent that can is an agent that can read every item in it. Tauri's main process reads the credential host-side and injects it as an environment variable into the sandboxed subprocess instead. This holds, but *not* because `security` is denied — see the correction below for what actually does it.
- **Any allowed network host is an exfiltration path.** The allowlist bounds blast radius, not data egress, and the README says so.
- **varnick never spawns a Claude Code process outside `srt` — not even to ask it a question.** The SDK's `query()` starts a Claude Code executable, and a session runs `SessionStart` hooks from the clone's `.claude/settings.json`, which the agent can write. So a host-side session — however short-lived, however read-only its intent — executes agent-authored code unconfined. Found while wiring plan usage, where reading a number needed a session and the obvious implementation opened its own. Any SDK control request must ride the confined session rather than open a second one. This is the rule most likely to be broken by accident, because the code that breaks it does not look like it starts an agent.

## Correction: what actually protects the Keychain

Two rounds of this were wrong before it was measured properly, so the measurement is written out in full. Darwin 25.5, `srt` 0.0.67, under the policy `sandboxPolicyFor` generates.

**The execution claim is false.** Denying read does not deny execution:

```
cat /usr/bin/security               -> Operation not permitted
/usr/bin/security ...               -> runs
/usr/bin/osascript -e 'return 6*7'  -> 42
/usr/bin/open --help                -> open's own usage error, so it ran
/usr/bin/sudo -n true               -> Operation not permitted (setuid, its own reason)
```

`srt`'s profile carries an unconditional `(allow process-exec)` while `denyRead` emits `file-read-data` denials. Those are different operations. Denying binaries could not have worked anyway: the Security framework links in-process, so a program the agent writes reaches the Keychain API with no `/usr/bin/security` involved.

**The Keychain is protected regardless, and not by any of that.** The same item, in two keychains differing only in location:

```
keychain in /private/tmp (readable)  -> the value, in plaintext
keychain under $HOME (denyRead)      -> not found
security list-keychains              -> only /Library/Keychains/System.keychain
cat ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db -> Operation not permitted
```

The login Keychain is invisible from inside the Sandbox. What gates it is `denyRead` on `$HOME` — the same kernel-enforced file denial that covers SSH keys and other repositories — because that is where the Keychain file lives. Both things varnick stores there, the credential and the Secrets Store, are covered.

Removing `com.apple.securityd.xpc` from `srt`'s Mach allowlist changes none of the above. It was measured because the allowlist looked like the cause; it is not.

- **The protection is incidental, not designed, and that is the risk worth carrying.** It holds because the Keychain happens to live under a denied path. Any future read-allow covering `$HOME` silently re-opens it — and there is real pressure toward exactly that, since a runtime installed under `~/.bun` or `~/.nvm` is unreadable for the same reason. Whatever is added must be narrow, and `packages/harness/src/sandbox.boundary.test.ts` asserts the Keychain stays unreachable so that widening it fails loudly.
- **`/Library/Keychains/System.keychain` is readable and dumpable from inside.** System certificates, not user secrets. Recorded because "the Keychain is protected" is otherwise too broad a sentence to be true.
- **`osascript` and `open` still execute.** Apple Events are denied, which removes the worst of it, but the deny-by-read reasoning does not work and should not be relied on anywhere else.

This adopts the design and the measurements from `zbc/packages/agent/docs/adr/0002-containment-wraps-the-cli-process.md`.
